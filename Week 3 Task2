  Hi Bob,

    It's me, Alice. You must believe me.
                            
    Think about our mutual dislike for olives and how we always pick them off our pizzas.
                            
    The account where you need to send the money we talked about is A52EE2A11E3717BCEAB76183759499FFB984BF50
                            
    Kind Regards,
    Alice
